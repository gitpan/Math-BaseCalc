   - Now supports non-integers.  Thanks to jdimov@cis.clarion.edu for
     idea (though I used a different implementation)

   - Handles large numbers (bigger than 2^32, or type 'int').

   - Fixed a problem with from_base() and negative numbers.  They were
     being treated as positive numbers.  [armengou@fonocom.es (Xavier Armengou)]
